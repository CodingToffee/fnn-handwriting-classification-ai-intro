# FNN for classification of handwritten numbers
This project was implemented as part of the university course "Introduction to AI".
The FNN was trained and tested with the [MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/phoebetronic/mnist).
It takes 784 pixel values as input and outputs the probability for each number from 0 - 9.

# Project setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CodingToffee/fnn-handwriting-classification-ai-intro.git
